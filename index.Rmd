## Notation Conventions

In this text we use the following conventions:
Lower case $x$ may be a vector or a scalar, random of fixed, as implied by the context. 
Upper case $A$ will stand for matrices. 
Equality $=$ is an equality, and $:=$ is a definition.
Norm functions are denoted with $\Vert x \Vert$ for vector norms, and $\Vert A \Vert$ for matrix norms. 
The type of norm is indicated in the subscript; e.g. $\Vert x \Vert_2$ for the Euclidean ($l_2$) norm.
Tag, $x'$ is a transpose. 
The distribution of a random vector is $\sim$.
